# What its about

* English Premier League database with help from some API's

* Browse through the clubs in the English Premier League

* Take a look at the live standings in the EPL

* The homepage shows the top scorers in the current season

## API's

* api-football

* heisenbug-premier-league-live-scorers

# Further implementations and difficulties faced

* A lot of the API's aren't free, so while making the app, ran into many issues with the API's

* It's nowhere near complete, but in the future if I were to continue, I would add Squads and Players using API's, currently it's limited to only an admin being able to edit and create new players and clubs

* Would also add fixtures and scores to the clubs and the homepage

* Due to API hindrances, some of the seeds had to be manually entered in order to show a somewhat working website

* Implement a search bar for the players

* Get the flag icon gem to link with the country select gem so that the icon turns up automatically when selecting the country

# What I learnt

* This project my main focus was to understand how to use API's

* Bootstrap

* Deployment of website to Heroku
